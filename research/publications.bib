  abstract = {Quantum sensing has a bright future for applications in need of impeccable sensitivities. The study of periodic fields has resulted in various techniques, which deal with the limited coherence time of the quantum sensor in several ways. However, the periodic signal to measure could include forms of randomness as well, such as changes in phase or in frequency. In such cases, long measurement times required to detect the smallest of field amplitudes hamper the effectiveness of conventional techniques. In this paper, we propose and explore a robust sensing technique to combat this problem. For the technique, instead of measuring the signal amplitude directly, we measure another global property of the signal, in this case the standard deviation. This results in a much-improved sensitivity. We analyze the advantages and limitations of this technique, and we demonstrate the working with a measurement using a nitrogen-vacancy center. This work encourages scouting measurements of alternative statistics.}

  abstract = {There are many extensions of the standard model that predict the existence of electroweakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), in particular in the context of the
              dark matter. WIMPs, which may be the dominant component of the dark matter, can
              be searched for using several different methods, such as the direct and indirect detection of the dark matter and the direct production at collider experiments. However, it
              is known that Higgsino, which is an example of the WIMP contained in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model, is difficult to search for in many cases. In this
              thesis, we provide a way for indirectly studying WIMPs through the precision study
              of the pair production processes of charged leptons or that of a charged lepton and a
              neutrino at future $100\,\mathrm{TeV}$ collider experiments. It is revealed that this search method
              is suitable in particular for Higgsino, providing us the $5\sigma$ discovery reach of Higgsino
              in supersymmetric model with mass up to $850\,\mathrm{GeV}$. We also show that this search
              method provides important and independent information about every kind of WIMP
              in addition to Higgsino. Finally, we also discuss how accurately one can extract the
              mass, gauge charge, and spin of WIMPs in our method.}
